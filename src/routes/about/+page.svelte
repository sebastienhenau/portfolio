			I'm a 30-year-old Belgian developer toggling my way into front-end
			architectures with my faithful cup of coffee next to me. Located in
			the heart of Belgium, I wear the hat as one of the lead developers
			at Little Miss Robot. Together with a great team, I am fortunate
			enough to contribute to making the internet a better place!

			When I am not losing myself in lines of code you'll likely catch me
			navigating running trails, attempting to conquer climbing walls (or
			just gracefully descend from them), playing some games on my trusty
			PlayStation or if I have some time left, read a book.

				I've been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to learn
				and work on some challenging projects at Little Miss Robot.
				Ranging from content websites to data driven web applications to
				experimental digital experiences. Each project has been a
				valuable opportunity for growth. This was all made possible
				through great teamwork with great people!
