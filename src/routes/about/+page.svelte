                    My name is SÃ©bastien, it's the french version of Sebastian. I know it's quite long, so "Seba" is
                    just fine. I've also had people call me "seblet" or "sebie", they are different, but I'm fine with
                    all of those!

                    So, who am I? I'm a developer from Belgium mainly focused on front-end development at the moment.
                    I'm working at <Link inline action={{ href: "http://www.spatie.be", target: "_blank" }}>
                        <LinkText>Spatie</LinkText></Link
                    >, gracefully toggling my way in their front-end architectures, with coffee obviously.
